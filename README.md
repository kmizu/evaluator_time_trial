evaluator_time_trial
====================

This repository is meaningless for any person except myself since it's just a time trial to measure the time to create a simple 
mathmatical expression evaluator.

## Purpose

My aim is to measure my coding speed and memory skill at my own game mainly.  The following rules exist in this challenge:

* Don' copy external resource and paste it into my codes directly.  But pasting it into *my brain* is OK.
* If at all possible, don't refer API documentation.  When API documentation is refered, write commit comment about that.
* Write commit comment about my mistake(typo is included, of course) in progress whenever it occurs.
* Advance preparation to commit information to memory is not problematic.
* Don't use editor/IDE completion features.
* This project must be simple sbt project at the end.
* The scala programs must be under `"com.github.kmizu"` or/and its sub-packages.
* By executing `sbt "run input.txt"`,  the mathematical expression in the file must be evaluated correctly.  A mathematical 
  expression must support integer literal, four arithmetic operators, and parentheses to enclose an expression.

### Result

* It tooks about 20 minutes until the completion.  Time without coding is included in 20 minutes.
* I made three mistakes.  Two mistakes are related to forgetting and one mistake is related to error.
* LOC is 27.
